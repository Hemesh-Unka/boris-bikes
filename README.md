**Week 1 Challenge at Makers Academy**: We are to build the structure for a new bike system, that involves a network of docking stations. Our job is to build a program to emulate all the docking stations, bikes and infrastructure for the system.

1. Clone the repository to your system
2. Redirect into the parent directory `cd boris-bikes`
3. Run IRB or and another Ruby REPL
4. Load in the files bike.rb, docking_station.rb, garage.rb, van.rb to get started `ie. require './lib/bike.rb'`
